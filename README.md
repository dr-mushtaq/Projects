# 📘 Lessons Learned from Starting a Side Project

This document outlines practical advice and mindset shifts for anyone who wants to **learn by doing** through side projects.  

It’s not about being perfect or following strict rules — it’s about experimenting, staying motivated, and learning valuable lessons along the way.  


## 🚀 Why Side Projects Matter
- They give you a **safe space to experiment** without fear of failure.  
- You can **learn new tools and skills** outside of your daily job.  
- Mistakes turn into **high-quality lessons** that stick with you.  

## 💡 Key Lessons

### 1. You Need a Challenge  
Nobody did anything innovative or creative without a challenge. If you think you're capable of doing something, add some more unknowns. Otherwise, you’re just pretending to grow.  

### 2. Side Projects Can Be Frustrating  
There will be times when you feel stuck and want to give up. Treat those moments as opportunities — the universe is giving you the chance to build real experience.  

### 3. The Best Lessons Come From Struggle  
The lessons you learn through trial and error are the most valuable. They build confidence and resilience.  

➡️ **Tip:** Start with something that excites you. Enthusiasm is fuel for progress.  

### 4. Share Your Work  
Pick something you can show to others. Asking for feedback — and listening to it — is one of the fastest ways to improve.  

- A **Code Review** is not just about style.  
- It’s about improving how you think and solve problems.  

### 5. Perfection Isn’t the Goal  
A side project doesn’t need to be flawless. It’s a playground for testing new ideas.  

At work, deadlines and risk reduction matter. In a side project, **freedom matters**.
